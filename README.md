hanged-man build in css, html and javascript.

I had some issues in the javascript, I try to improve that and raise the level with every project.

I used the BEM standard in CSS and want to add more updates in the javascript files of course, right now I am focused in learn better the tecnologies and then apply it correctly in this projects.

I am very exited because I have learned a lot in this months and I cannot imagine what will learn in the future, this is just the begining.
